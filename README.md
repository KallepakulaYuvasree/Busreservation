Bus Reservation System is a tool that allows users to book tickets for their journey in advance. It offers multiple features to provide a hassle-free experience to a traveler. This article aims at building a rudimentary Bus Reservation System.

**Components of the Bus Reservation System**
Login System: Users can access the system by entering their username and password. The program provides a collection of preconfigured users and their credentials.
Ticket Purchase: Logged-in individuals may reserve tickets for available buses by entering the bus number, their name, and age. The program allocates a seat number and decreases the number of available seats on the selected bus.
Cancel Tickets: By entering their name, users can cancel their tickets. The program expands the number of available seats while removing the passenger entry.
Checking Bus Status: Users may check the status of the bus they are currently scheduled to ride on. The program displays information such as the bus number, origin and destination, total number of seats, available seats, and fare.
